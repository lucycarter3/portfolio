         <p>This project we starting looking at creating animations with maya
           then taking a snapshot of that animation and using keyshot to apply
           and edit materials. I wanted to play with the idea of weight and bubbles 
           pushing through a surface as well as glossy and matte reflections. I was
           inspired by confusing the brain with different weighted materials and
           the affects they would have on one another.

         <p>A collaborative group project with Hayley Bell, Kavana Kipa-Si'ueva, Roshaan Bhana, Tor Halle-McLntyre and the initial design by Hayley Bell.</p>
          <p>Sprout is a toothbrush holder designed to water plants as you wash your toothbrush after brushing your teeth to eliminate grey water waste that could
            be used otherwise. The design consits of three main components; the first being a 3D printed lining and divider than can be removed from the CNC structure 
            in order to clean it. The last main component is the base 3D print that doesn't detach from the CNC component but this is where a central peak pushes the 
            grey water either side to water the plants.</p>
          <p>My personal contribution to this project was working on the initial redesign of the product
            and design and manufacturing of packaging.

         <p>Our challenge for this project was to design a light by building the circuit using LED strips.
           My design LYBRNTH3 is a series of three cubes all different with either 0, 90 or 360 degree rotation in order to 
           connect the copper tape/ circuit in order to turn the light on. My three different lights look at using a voronoi 
           pattern, curve stitching and a 360 maze.  My inspiration for creating my three lights was for them all produced different
           streams of light using different shade motifs.
