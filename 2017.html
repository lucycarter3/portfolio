         <p>My Photography work looks into portraying sound vibrations through imagery. My work was shot all in studio and was heavily photoshop, as well as some images were fabricated from other images. The whole collection of images looks at showing the process of sounds throughout my work. I did this by introducing musical instruments through the beginning of my work then evolving to more abstract images and starting to be able to refine my work. Throughout my work I looked at working with images in series and different view points. The inspiration for my work was from my love of music. I love listening to music loud enough to feel sound vibrations and wanted to capture these through being able to feel sound vibrations so I wanted to capture through photographs. </p>

         <p>This is the brief that I based my design work on; The New Zealand Education Department in conjunction with the Health Department are concerned about the amount of time children, teenagers and young adults in this day and age are spending on Computer screens and in particular, hand-held devices. They plan to launch a campaign called ‘offline’ which will promote a controlled use of technology. The aim of the campaign is to encourage young people to spend at least three hours a day without their phones, computers, iPads and other devices. They wish to encourage sports, outdoor activities, and to further social interaction between peers. I wanted to use humour as a tool to educate and captivate. My inspiration behind my designs comes from wanting to draw the attention of younger generations away from technology. I was fortunate enough to spend a lot of time outdoors growing up and creating memories I wouldn't otherwise spending time on devices.  </p>
