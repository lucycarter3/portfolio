          <p>Sound Sculpt is a speaker that is designed to allow your input into the final outcome in order to create a bispoke piece.
        </p>
        <p>
            Inspired by the 2020 Covid19 lockdown, Sound Sculpt is a kit with all the necessary components included. It’ll give you an activity to do when at home in lockdown resulting in a personalised and useable addition to your home. It is easily accessible by purchasing though www.soundsculpt.co.nz and you can choose from one of several pre carved forms allowing the you a beginning point for your input to make it bespoke. </p>
          <p>Within the kit there are several carving tools to work with and various small metal sheets to smooth down the final product.
        </p>
        <p>The speaker is a seperate unit with the bespoke part detachable to allow several people within your household to create their own design and make it interchangeable at any point. This means when purchasing on our website you can also purchase seperate wax starting points of multiple coloiur options so an entire household can participate in a lockdown activity or so you can just keep designing. 
        </p>
        <p>The product is easily detachable by placing the cylinder of the carved component within the speaker itself.  It was designed for the two components to be completely seperate so that you won’t accidentally damage any electronic components and thereby ruin them, resulting in the speaker no longer working. 
        </p>
        <p>“I wanted to design this speaker to spark creatvity within everyone and to allow everyone to have a hand in desiging the items with we surround ourselves daily. This product doesn’t require to have the skills to build the speaker from scratch but leaves space for your input and flare.”
        </p>

      <p>Due to Covid19 disruption I was unable to make this product.</p>

            <p>There isn’t an easily readable device for the everyday consumer</p>
            <p>4.2 million deaths per year caused by lung cancer, stroke, chronic respiratory and heart diseases as a result of being exposed to air pollutants. 23% of global deaths are related to the environment. 91% of the world exceeds the World Health Organisation guideline pollution limits which looks at a combination of particle matter, ozone, nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide. </p>
            <p>I wanted to create a device for the everyday consumer that gives them a quick and clear indication of air pollution with access to more in-depth information</p>
            <p>The design incudes LED lights to indicate level of pollution, a small air intake which doubles as button to retrieve a reading at the consumers desire not just every 20 mins as the device does automatically, interchangeable attachments for watch or necklace attachment making it custom to the consumer.</p>

            <p>A collaborative group project with Reilly Beaumont-Orr, Leo Wang and initial design by Reilly Beaumont-Orr.</p>
            <p>RUFUS is a safety device designed to be placed level
              with roads in order to implement safer driving through
              immediate feedback regarding current weather
              conditions which may affect the state of the road.
              RUFUS communicates either Green, Yellow or Red to
              indicate which state the road itself might be in, with each
              colour showing the driver how dangerous the road may
              be at that time.The issue RUFUS is trying to aid is that of dangerous
              driving conditions when the weather turns cold enough
              to ice over. Ice is a very dangerous aspect of winter
              roads, with black ice forming over cold surfaces but
              remaining hidden to the human eye, meaning the drivers
              are literally on very dangerous thin ice. RUFUS aim’s to
              warn drivers of certain weather conditions in real time
              while they drive, without having them divert their
              attention to reading signs.</p>

              <p>My personal contribution to this project was working with
                arduino components to create the circuit and write the code.
